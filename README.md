SDL2 bindings for Node.js.
Provides window management, input events, audio playback/recording, and clipboard manipulation.
You can use it together with [@kmamal/gl](https://github.com/kmamal/headless-gl#readme) to get native WebGL drawing without having to use a browser.

It should work on Linux, Mac, and Windows.
Prebuilt binaries are available for x64 architectures.


## Installation

SDL2 is bundled along with the binaries so a separate installation is not necessary.
This package is self-contained.
Just run:

```
npm install @kmamal/sdl
```

(But if things go wrong do look over [here](#installing-sdl2))


## Example

```js
const sdl = require('@kmamal/sdl')
const createContext = require('@kmamal/gl')

const window = sdl.video.createWindow({
  title: "Hello, World!"
  opengl: true,
})

// Clear screen to red
const { width, height, native } = window
const gl = createContext(width, height, { window: native })
gl.clearColor(1, 0, 0, 1)
gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)
gl.swap()
```

There are more examples [in the `examples/` folder](https://github.com/kmamal/node-sdl/tree/master/examples), covering several common use cases, including how to draw using Canvas and WebGL, as well as how to package the application for distribution.

## sdl

### Event: 'beforeQuit'

* `prevent: <function (void) => void>` Call this to prevent the application from closing.

Fired to indicate that the user has requested the application to close (usually by closing the last window).
If you need to display any confirmation dialogs you should call `event.prevent()` and handle termination manually.
If `prevent` is not called, then this event will be followed by a [`'quit'`](#event-quit) event.

### Event: 'quit'

Indicates that the application is about to close.
Handle any cleanup here.
This event will be followed by a call to `process.exit()`.

### sdl.info

* `<object>`
  * `version: <object>`
    * `compile: <object>` The SDL2 version the bindings were compiled against.
      * `major, minor, patch: <semver>` The components of the version.
    * `runtime: <object>` The SDL2 version of the dynamic library the is loaded.
      * `major, minor, patch: <semver>` The components of the version.
  * `platform: <string>` The name of the platform we are running on. Possible values are: `'Linux'`, `'Windows'`, and `'Mac OS X'`.
  * `drivers: <object>`
    * `video: <object>`
      * `all: <string>[]` A list of all video drivers.
      * `current: <string>` The video driver that is currently selected.
    * `audio: <object>`
      * `all: <string>[]` A list of all audio drivers.
      * `current: <string>` The audio driver that is currently selected.

This object is filled with the information produced during the initialization of SDL2.
All the values will remain constant throughout the execution of the program.
If you want to initialize SDL2 with drivers other than the default ones, you can do so via its [environment variables](https://wiki.libsdl.org/FAQUsingSDL).

Sample data for Ubuntu:

```js
{
  version: {
    compile: { major: 2, minor: 0, patch: 10 },
    runtime: { major: 2, minor: 0, patch: 10 },
  },
  platform: 'Linux',
  drivers: {
    video: {
      all: [ 'x11', 'wayland', 'dummy' ],
      current: 'x11',
    },
    audio: {
      all: [ 'pulseaudio', 'alsa', 'sndio', 'dsp', 'disk', 'dummy' ],
      current: 'pulseaudio',
    },
  },
}
```


## sdl.video

### Image data

There are 3 places in the API where you will need to provide an image to the library:
* [`window.render()`](#windowrenderwidth-height-stride-format-buffer)
* [`window.setIcon()`](#windowseticonwidth-height-stride-format-buffer)
* [`mouse.setCursorImage()`](#sdlmousesetcursorimagewidth-height-stride-format-buffer-x-y)

All three of these functions accept the image as a series of arguments:
* `width: <number>` The width of the image in pixels.
* `height: <number>` The height of the image in pixels.
* `stride: <number>` How many bytes each row of the image takes up in the buffer. This is usually equal to `width * bytesPerPixel`, but can be larger if the rows of the buffer are padded to always be some multiple of bytes.
* `format: `[`<PixelFormat>`](#pixel-formats) The binary representation of the data in the buffer.
* `buffer: <Buffer>` Holds the actual pixel data for the image, in the format and layout specified by all the above arguments.

So for example, to fill the window with a red+green gradient you could do:

```js
const { width, height } = window
const stride = width * 4
const buffer = Buffer.alloc(stride * height)

let offset = 0
for (let i = 0; i < height; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < width; j++) {
    buffer[offset++] = Math.floor(256 * i / height) // R
    buffer[offset++] = Math.floor(256 * j / width)  // G
    buffer[offset++] = 0                            // B
    buffer[offset++] = 255                          // A
  }
}

window.render(width, height, stride, 'rgba32', buffer)
```

Creates a new window.

The following restrictions apply:
* If you specify the `display` option, you can't also specify the `x` or `y` options, and vice-versa.
* The `resizable` and `borderless` options can't both be true.
* The `vsync` option only applies to windows that are also `accelerated`.

If you set the `opengl` option, then you can only render to the window with OpenGL calls.
Calls to [`render()`](#windowrenderwidth-height-stride-format-buffer) will fail.

## sdl.audio

### Audio data

The [`playbackInstance.enqueue()`](#playbackinstanceenqueuebuffer-bytes) function expects a buffer of audio data as input and the [`recordingInstance.dequeue()`](#recordinginstancedequeuebuffer-bytes) function returns a buffer of audio data as output.
The format of the data in these buffers depends on the options you passed to [`sdl.audio.openDevice()`](#sdlaudioopendevicedevice-options).

Audio data are a sequence of frames, with each frame being a sequence of samples.
A _sample_ is a single number representing the intensity of a single audio channel at a specific point in time.
For audio with multiple channels, each point in time is represented by one sample per channel.
This is called a _frame_.
The samples in a frame are arranged as follows:
* For 1 channel (mono) a frame contains just the one sample.
* For 2 channels (stereo) the frame's first sample will be the one for the left channel, followed by the one for the right channel.
* For 4 channels (quad) the layout is front-left, front-right, rear-left, rear-right.
* For 6 channels (5.1) the layout is front-left, front-right, center, low-freq, rear-left, rear-right.

So for example, to fill a buffer with 3 seconds of a 440Hz sine wave, you could do:

```js
const TWO_PI = 2 * Math.PI

const {
  channels,
  frequency,
  bytesPerSample,
  minSampleValue,
  maxSampleValue,
  zeroSampleValue,
} = playbackInstance

const range = maxSampleValue - minSampleValue
const amplitude = range / 2

const sineAmplitude = 0.3 * amplitude
const sineNote = 440
const sinePeriod = 1 / sineNote

const duration = 3
const numFrames = duration * frequency
const numSamples = numFrames * channels
const numBytes = numSamples * bytesPerSample
const buffer = Buffer.alloc(numBytes)

let offset = 0
for (let i = 0; i < numFrames; i++) {
  const time = i / frequency
  const angle = time / sinePeriod * TWO_PI
  const sample = zeroSampleValue + Math.sin(angle) * sineAmplitude
  for (let j = 0; j < channels; j++) {
    offset = playbackInstance.writeSample(buffer, sample, offset)
  }
}
```

If the opened device is a playback device, then the returned object will be an [`AudioPlaybackInstance`](#class-audioplaybackinstance-extends-audioinstance), otherwise it will be an [`AudioRecordingInstance`](#class-audiorecordinginstance-extends-audioinstance).

The `channels`, `frequency` and `format` options together define what the data in the `Buffer` objects you read from or write to the instance will look like.
See also the section on [audio data](#audio-data).

The `buffered` option specifies the "delay" that you will experience between the application and the audio driver.
With smaller values you will have smaller delays, but you will also have to read/write data from/to the driver more frequently.
Applications such as virtual instruments that need to play audio in reaction to user input will want to change this option to lower values.

## sdl.keyboard

There are three levels at which you can deal with the keyboard: physical keys ([scancodes](#enum-scancode)), virtual keys ([keys](#virtual-keys)), and text ([`'textInput'`](#event-textinput) events).

On the physical level, each of the physical keys corresponds to a number: the key's scancode.
For any given keyboard, the same key will always produce the same scancode.
If your application cares about the layout of the keyboard (for example using the "WASD" keys as a substitute for arrow keys), then you should handle key events at this level using the `scancode` property of [`'keyDown'`](#event-keydown) and [`'keyUp'`](#event-keyup) events.

For the most part it's better to treat scancode values as arbitrary/meaningless, but SDL does provide a scancode enumeration with values based on the [USB usage page standard](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/documents/hut1_12v2.pdf) so you should be able to derive some meaning from the scancodes if your keyboard is compatible.

More commonly, you don't care about the physical key itself but about the "meaning" associated with each key: the character that it produces ("a", "b", "@", " ", .e.t.c) or the function that it corresponds to ("Esc", "F4", "Ctrl",  e.t.c.).
Your operating system provides a "keyboard mapping" that associates physical keys with their corresponding meaning.
Changing the keyboard mapping (for example by changing the language from English to German) will also change the corresponding meaning for each key (in the English-German example: the "y" and "z" keys will be switched).
These meanings are represented as [virtual key strings](#virtual-keys).
If your application cares about the meaning associated with individual keys then you should handle key events at this level using the `key` property of [`'keyDown'`](#event-keydown) and [`'keyUp'`](#event-keyup) events.

Note that not all physical keys correspond to a well-defined meaning and thus don't have a virtual key value associated with them.
The key events for these keys will have a `null` value for the `key` property.

But sometimes the application doesn't care about individual keys at all, but about the resulting text that the user is entering.
Consider for example what happens when a user on a Greek keyboard layout enters an accent mark "´" followed by the letter "α" to produce the character "ά": Two keys were pressed, but only a single character was produced.
Trying to handle text input by manually translating key presses to text is not a very viable solution.
It's better to let the OS handle all the text logic, and get the final text by handling the rasulting ([`'textInput'`](#event-textinput)) events.


### Enum: SCANCODE

Used to represent physical keys on the keyboard.
The same key will always produce the same scancode.
Values are based on the [USB usage page standard](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/documents/hut1_12v2.pdf).

### Virtual keys

String values used to represent virtual keys in the context of the current keyboard mapping.
Note that some keys do not correspond to any virtual key.
A Key can be either one of the values below __or__ any unicode character.
Keys that produce characters are represented by that character.
All others are represented by one of these values:

`'&&'`, `'+/-'`, `'||'`, `'00'`, `'000'`, `'again'`, `'alt'`, `'altErase'`, `'app1'`, `'app2'`, `'application'`, `'audioFastForward'`, `'audioMute'`, `'audioNext'`, `'audioPlay'`, `'audioPrev'`, `'audioRewind'`, `'audioStop'`, `'back'`, `'backspace'`, `'binary'`, `'bookmarks'`, `'brightnessDown'`, `'brightnessUp'`, `'calculator'`, `'cancel'`, `'capsLock'`, `'clear'`, `'clearEntry'`, `'computer'`, `'copy'`, `'crSel'`, `'ctrl'`, `'currencySubUnit'`, `'currencyUnit'`, `'cut'`, `'decimal'`, `'decimalSeparator'`, `'delete'`, `'displaySwitch'`, `'down'`, `'eject'`, `'end'`, `'enter'`, `'escape'`, `'execute'`, `'exSel'`, `'f1'`, `'f2'`, `'f3'`, `'f4'`, `'f5'`, `'f6'`, `'f7'`, `'f8'`, `'f9'`, `'f10'`, `'f11'`, `'f12'`, `'f13'`, `'f14'`, `'f15'`, `'f16'`, `'f17'`, `'f18'`, `'f19'`, `'f20'`, `'f21'`, `'f22'`, `'f23'`, `'f24'`, `'find'`, `'forward'`, `'gui'`, `'help'`, `'hexadecimal'`, `'home'`, `'illumDown'`, `'illumToggle'`, `'illumUp'`, `'insert'`, `'left'`, `'mail'`, `'mediaSelect'`, `'memAdd'`, `'memClear'`, `'memDivide'`, `'memMultiply'`, `'memRecall'`, `'memStore'`, `'memSubtract'`, `'menu'`, `'modeSwitch'`, `'mute'`, `'numlock'`, `'octal'`, `'oper'`, `'out'`, `'pageDown'`, `'pageUp'`, `'paste'`, `'pause'`, `'power'`, `'printScreen'`, `'prior'`, `'refresh'`, `'return'`, `'right'`, `'scrollLock'`, `'search'`, `'select'`, `'separator'`, `'shift'`, `'sleep'`, `'space'`, `'stop'`, `'sysReq'`, `'tab'`, `'thousandsSeparator'`, `'undo'`, `'up'`, `'volumeDown'`, `'volumeUp'`, `'www'`, `'xor'`.

### sdl.keyboard.getKey(scancode)

* `scancode: `[`<Scancode>`](#enum-scancode)
* Returns: [`<Key>`](#virtual-keys)`|<null>`

Maps a scancode to the corresponding key based on the current keyboard mapping.

### sdl.keyboard.getScancode(key)

* `key: `[`<Key>`](#virtual-keys)
* Returns: [`<Scancode>`](#enum-scancode)

Maps a key to the corresponding scancode based on the current keyboard mapping.
If multiple physical keys produce the same virtual key, then only the first one will be returned.

### sdl.keyboard.getState()

* Returns: `<boolean[]>` an object representing the state of each key.

The returned array can be indexed with [`Scancode`](#enum-scancode) values.
Pressed keys will correspond to `true` values.


## sdl.mouse

### Mouse cursors

### Installing SDL2

This should not be necessary, since this package bundles the SDL2 runtime library along with its binaries, but you never know...

This package depends on SDL2 `>=2.0.5`.
To install it on your system you might have to download one of the [SDL2 Runtime Binaries](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).
* __Linux:__ Run `sudo apt install libsdl2-2.0-0` or whatever the equivalent command is for your package manager.
* __Mac:__ Download the `.dmg` file, open it, and copy the `SDL2.framework` to `/Library/Frameworks`.
* __Windows:__ Download the `.zip` file, extract it, and copy the `.dll` files to a path Node.js can link them from. This will usually be your system directory (`C:\Windows`) but see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order) for other paths where Windows will look for `.dll` files to link.
