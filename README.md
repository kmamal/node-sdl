SDL bindings for Node.js. Provides access to systems that are not normally available to Node.js applications:

- ðŸ’» Window management
- âŒ¨ Keyboard
- ðŸ–± Mouse
- ðŸ•¹ Joysticks
- ðŸŽ® Controllers
- ðŸ”ˆ Audio playback
- ðŸŽ¤ Audio recording
- ðŸ“‹ Clipboard manipulation
- ðŸ”‹ Battery status
- ðŸ§­ Sensors

Also allows using Canvas2D, WebGL, and WebGPU without a browser, through these libraries:

- __Canvas2D:__ [@napi-rs/canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@napi-rs/canvas). In my experience, this is the fastest library out of the many available on npm.
- __WebGL:__ [@kmamal/gl](https://github.com/kmamal/headless-gl#readme). This is a fork of [headless-gl](https://github.com/stackgl/headless-gl#readme) that I've modified to render directly to SDL windows.
- __WebGPU:__ [@kmamal/gpu](https://github.com/kmamal/gpu#readme). This is a fork of [Google Dawn](https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn/+/refs/heads/main/src/dawn/node/) that I've modified to render directly to SDL windows.

Officially supports Linux (x64, arm64), Mac (x64, arm64), and Windows (x64).
Should theoretically work on any system supported by both SDL and Node.js, but I haven't tried any others.
Prebuilt binaries are available for the supported architectures.

## Installation

This package is self-contained. Just run:

```bash
npm install @kmamal/sdl
```

You do __not__ have to manually install any other libs or DLLs to your system. A compatible version of SDL will be automatically downloaded by the install script and placed inside `node_modules` along with this lib's prebuilt binding binaries.

(But if the install script fails, have a look at the instructions for [building the package manually](#building-from-source))

## Examples

### "Hello, World!"

```js
import sdl from '@kmamal/sdl'

const window = sdl.video.createWindow({ title: "Hello, World!" })
window.on('*', console.log)
```

### Canvas2D

```js
import sdl from '@kmamal/sdl'
import { createCanvas } from '@napi-rs/canvas'

// Setup
const window = sdl.video.createWindow({ title: "Canvas2D" })
const { pixelWidth: width, pixelHeight: height } = window
const canvas = createCanvas(width, height)
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d')

// Clear screen to red
ctx.fillStyle = 'red'
ctx.fillRect(0, 0, width, height)

// Render to window
const buffer = Buffer.from(ctx.getImageData(0, 0, width, height).data)
window.render(width, height, width * 4, 'rgba32', buffer)
```

### WebGL

```js
import sdl from '@kmamal/sdl'
import createContext from '@kmamal/gl'

// Setup
const window = sdl.video.createWindow({ title: "WebGL", opengl: true })
const { pixelWidth: width, pixelHeight: height, native } = window
const gl = createContext(width, height, { window: native })

// Clear screen to red
gl.clearColor(1, 0, 0, 1)
gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)

// Render to window
gl.swap()
```

### WebGPU

```js
import sdl from '@kmamal/sdl'
import gpu from '@kmamal/gpu'

// Setup
const window = sdl.video.createWindow({ title: "WebGPU", webgpu: true })
const instance = gpu.create([])
const adapter = await instance.requestAdapter()
const device = await adapter.requestDevice()
const renderer = gpu.renderGPUDeviceToWindow({ device, window })

// Clear screen to red
const commandEncoder = device.createCommandEncoder()
const renderPass = commandEncoder.beginRenderPass({
  colorAttachments: [
    {
      view: renderer.getCurrentTextureView(),
      clearValue: { r: 1.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, a: 1.0 },
      loadOp: 'clear',
      storeOp: 'store',
    },
  ],
})
renderPass.end()
device.queue.submit([ commandEncoder.finish() ])

// Render to window
renderer.swap()

```

## sdl

### sdl.info

- `<object>`
  - `version: <object>`
    - `compile: <object>` The version of the SDL library that this package was compiled against.
      - `major, minor, patch: <Semver>` The components of the version.
    - `runtime: <object>` The version of the SDL library that was found and loaded at runtime.
      - `major, minor, patch: <Semver>` The components of the version.
  - `platform: <string>` The name of the platform we are running on. Possible values are: `'Linux'`, `'Windows'`, and `'Mac OS X'`.
  - `drivers: <object>`
    - `video: <object>`
      - `all: <string>[]` A list of all video drivers.
      - `current: <string>|<null>` The video driver that is currently selected.
    - `audio: <object>`
      - `all: <string>[]` A list of all audio drivers.
      - `current: <string>|<null>` The audio driver that is currently selected.
  - `initialized: <object>`
    - `video: <boolean>`: Is `true` if the video subsystem was successfully initialized, or `false` otherwise.
    - `audio: <boolean>`: Is `true` if the audio subsystem was successfully initialized, or `false` otherwise.
    - `joystick: <boolean>`: Is `true` if the joystick subsystem was successfully initialized, or `false` otherwise.
    - `controller: <boolean>`: Is `true` if the controller subsystem was successfully initialized, or `false` otherwise.
    - `haptic: <boolean>`: Is `true` if the haptic subsystem was successfully initialized, or `false` otherwise.
    - `sensor: <boolean>`: Is `true` if the sensor subsystem was successfully initialized, or `false` otherwise.

The `sdl.info` object is filled with information produced during the initialization of SDL.
All the values remain constant throughout the execution of the program.

To initialize SDL with video/audio drivers other than the default ones, set the appropriate [environment variables](https://wiki.libsdl.org/FAQUsingSDL) to the desired value.

Note that the `current` video or audio driver may be `null`.
This usually happens on systems that don't have any compatible devices, such as on a CI pipeline.

Sample data for Ubuntu:

```js
{
  version: {
    compile: { major: 2, minor: 0, patch: 10 },
    runtime: { major: 2, minor: 0, patch: 10 },
  },
  platform: 'Linux',
  drivers: {
    video: {
      all: [ 'x11', 'wayland', 'dummy' ],
      current: 'x11',
    },
    audio: {
      all: [ 'pulseaudio', 'alsa', 'sndio', 'dsp', 'disk', 'dummy' ],
      current: 'pulseaudio',
    },
  },
  initialized: {
    video: true,
    audio: true,
    joystick: true,
    controller: true,
    haptic: true,
    sensor: true,
  },
}
```

## sdl.video

### Image data

There are 3 places in the API where you must provide an image to the library:

- [`window.render()`](#windowrenderwidth-height-stride-format-buffer-options)
- [`window.setIcon()`](#windowseticonwidth-height-stride-format-buffer)
- [`mouse.setCursorImage()`](#sdlmousesetcursorimagewidth-height-stride-format-buffer-x-y)

All three of these functions accept the image as a series of arguments:

- `width: <number>` The width of the image in pixels.
- `height: <number>` The height of the image in pixels.
- `stride: <number>` How many bytes each row of the image takes up in the buffer. Usually equal to `width * bytesPerPixel`, but may be larger if the rows of the buffer are padded to always be some multiple of bytes.
- `format: `[`<PixelFormat>`](#pixel-formats) The binary representation of the data in the buffer.
- `buffer: <Buffer>` Holds the actual pixel data for the image, in the format and layout specified by all the above arguments.

So, for example, to fill the window with a red+green gradient you could do:

```js
const { pixelWidth: width, pixelHeight: height } = window
const stride = width * 4
const buffer = Buffer.alloc(stride * height)

let offset = 0
for (let i = 0; i < height; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < width; j++) {
    buffer[offset++] = Math.floor(256 * i / height) // R
    buffer[offset++] = Math.floor(256 * j / width)  // G
    buffer[offset++] = 0                            // B
    buffer[offset++] = 255                          // A
  }
}

window.render(width, height, stride, 'rgba32', buffer)
```

### High-DPI

On a high-dpi display, windows have more pixels than their `width` and `height` would indicate.
On such systems `width` and `height` (and all other measurements such as `x` and `y`) are measured in "points" instead of pixels.
Points are an abstract unit of measurement and don't necessarily correspond to pixels.
If you need to work with pixels, you can use the window's `pixelWidth` and `pixelHeight` properties.
You usually need these values when creating a "surface" that will be displayed on the window, such as a Buffer, Canvas, or 3D rendering viewport.
I recommend that in these cases you always use `pixelWidth` and `pixelHeight`, since you don't know beforehand if your program will be running on a high-dpi system or not.

### Pixel formats

String values used to represent how the pixels of an image are stored in a Buffer.

- The `resizable` and `borderless` options are mutually exclusive.
- The `opengl` and `webgpu` options are mutually exclusive.
- The `vsync` option only applies to windows that are also `accelerated`.
- The `accelerated` and `vsync` options have no effect if either `opengl` or `webgpu` is also specified.

If you set the `opengl` or `webgpu` options, then you must use OpenGL/WebGPU calls to render to the window.
Calls to [`render()`](#windowrenderwidth-height-stride-format-buffer-options) will fail.

## class Window

  - `dstRect: <object>` Where exactly on the window to draw the image. Default: whole window.
    - `x, y, width, height: <rect>` The components of the rectangle.

Displays an image in the window.

By default the image is displayed over the entire surface of the window.
You may pass the optional `dstRect` parameter to set where exactly on the window to display the image.
The rest of the window will be filled with black.

If the dimensions of the image do not match the dimensions of the area it should be displayed in, then the image will be stretched to match.
The `scaling` argument controls how exactly the scaling is implemented.
Possible values are:

| Value       | Corresponding `SDL_ScaleMode` | Description            |

The difference between this function and [destroy()](#windowdestroy) is that this function first makes the window emit the [`'beforeClose'`](#event-beforeclose) event, giving you a chance to prevent the window from being destroyed.

## sdl.keyboard

There are three levels at which you can deal with the keyboard: physical keys ([scancodes](#enum-scancode)), virtual keys ([keys](#virtual-keys)), and text ([`'textInput'`](#event-textinput) events).

On the physical level, each of the physical keys corresponds to a number: the key's scancode.
For any given keyboard, the same key will always produce the same scancode.
If your application cares about the layout of the keyboard (for example using the "WASD" keys as a substitute for arrow keys), then you should handle key events at this level using the `scancode` property of [`'keyDown'`](#event-keydown) and [`'keyUp'`](#event-keyup) events.

For the most part it's better to treat scancode values as arbitrary/meaningless, but SDL does provide a scancode enumeration with values based on the [USB usage page standard](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/documents/hut1_12v2.pdf) so you should be able to derive some meaning from the scancodes if your keyboard is compatible.

More commonly, you don't care about the physical key itself but about the "meaning" associated with each key:
the character that it produces ("a", "b", "@", " ", .e.t.c.) or the function that it corresponds to ("Esc", "F4", "Ctrl",  e.t.c.).
Your operating system provides a "keyboard mapping" that associates physical keys with their corresponding meaning.
Changing the keyboard mapping (for example by changing the language from English to German) will also change the corresponding meaning for each key (in the English-German example: the "y" and "z" keys will be switched).
These meanings are represented as [virtual key strings](#virtual-keys).
If your application cares about the meaning associated with individual keys then you should handle key events at this level using the `key` property of [`'keyDown'`](#event-keydown) and [`'keyUp'`](#event-keyup) events.

Note that not all physical keys correspond to a well-defined meaning and thus don't have a virtual key value associated with them.
The key events for these keys will have a `null` value for the `key` property.

But sometimes the application doesn't care about individual keys at all, but about the resulting text that the user is entering.
Consider for example what happens when a user on a Greek keyboard layout enters an accent mark "Â´" followed by the letter "Î±" to produce the character "Î¬": Two keys were pressed, but only a single character was produced.
Trying to handle text input by manually translating key presses to text is not a very viable solution.
It's better to let the OS handle all the text logic, and get the final text by handling the rasulting ([`'textInput'`](#event-textinput)) events.

### Virtual keys

String values used to represent virtual keys in the context of the current keyboard mapping.
Note that some keys do not correspond to any virtual key.
A Key can be either one of the values below __or__ any unicode character.
Keys that produce characters are represented by that character.
All others are represented by one of these values:

`'&&'`, `'+/-'`, `'||'`, `'00'`, `'000'`, `'again'`, `'alt'`, `'altErase'`, `'app1'`, `'app2'`, `'application'`, `'audioFastForward'`, `'audioMute'`, `'audioNext'`, `'audioPlay'`, `'audioPrev'`, `'audioRewind'`, `'audioStop'`, `'back'`, `'backspace'`, `'binary'`, `'bookmarks'`, `'brightnessDown'`, `'brightnessUp'`, `'calculator'`, `'cancel'`, `'capsLock'`, `'clear'`, `'clearEntry'`, `'computer'`, `'copy'`, `'crSel'`, `'ctrl'`, `'currencySubUnit'`, `'currencyUnit'`, `'cut'`, `'decimal'`, `'decimalSeparator'`, `'delete'`, `'displaySwitch'`, `'down'`, `'eject'`, `'end'`, `'enter'`, `'escape'`, `'execute'`, `'exSel'`, `'f1'`, `'f2'`, `'f3'`, `'f4'`, `'f5'`, `'f6'`, `'f7'`, `'f8'`, `'f9'`, `'f10'`, `'f11'`, `'f12'`, `'f13'`, `'f14'`, `'f15'`, `'f16'`, `'f17'`, `'f18'`, `'f19'`, `'f20'`, `'f21'`, `'f22'`, `'f23'`, `'f24'`, `'find'`, `'forward'`, `'gui'`, `'help'`, `'hexadecimal'`, `'home'`, `'illumDown'`, `'illumToggle'`, `'illumUp'`, `'insert'`, `'left'`, `'mail'`, `'mediaSelect'`, `'memAdd'`, `'memClear'`, `'memDivide'`, `'memMultiply'`, `'memRecall'`, `'memStore'`, `'memSubtract'`, `'menu'`, `'modeSwitch'`, `'mute'`, `'numlock'`, `'octal'`, `'oper'`, `'out'`, `'pageDown'`, `'pageUp'`, `'paste'`, `'pause'`, `'power'`, `'printScreen'`, `'prior'`, `'refresh'`, `'return'`, `'right'`, `'scrollLock'`, `'search'`, `'select'`, `'separator'`, `'shift'`, `'sleep'`, `'space'`, `'stop'`, `'sysReq'`, `'tab'`, `'thousandsSeparator'`, `'undo'`, `'up'`, `'volumeDown'`, `'volumeUp'`, `'www'`, `'xor'`.

### Enum: SCANCODE

Used to represent physical keys on the keyboard.
The same key will always produce the same scancode.
Values are based on the [USB usage page standard](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/documents/hut1_12v2.pdf).

  | `sdl.keyboard.SCANCODE.NONUSHASH`          | `SDL_SCANCODE_NONUSHASH`          | ISO USB keyboards actually use this code instead of 49 for the same key, but all OSes I've seen treat the two codes identically. So, as an implementor, unless your keyboard generates both of those codes and your OS treats them differently, you should generate SDL_SCANCODE_BACKSLASH instead of this code. As a user, you should not rely on this code because SDL will never generate it with most (all?) keyboards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### Event: 'keymapChange'

Fired when the keymap changes due to a system event such as an input language or keyboard layout change.
After this event, the correspondance between physical and logical keys might have changed.
You should assume that any previous result you have gotten from [`getKey()`](#sdlkeyboardgetkeyscancode) or [`getScancode()`](#sdlkeyboardgetscancodekey) are not invalid.

### sdl.keyboard.getKey(scancode)

- `scancode: `[`<Scancode>`](#enum-scancode)
- Returns: [`<Key>`](#virtual-keys)`|<null>`

Maps a scancode to the corresponding key based on the current keyboard mapping.
Retuns `null` if the scancode does not currespond to a key in the current mapping.

### sdl.keyboard.getScancode(key)

- `key: `[`<Key>`](#virtual-keys)
- Returns: [`<Scancode>`](#enum-scancode)`|<null>`

Maps a key to the corresponding scancode based on the current keyboard mapping.
Retuns `null` if the key does not currespond to a scancode in the current mapping.
If multiple physical keys produce the same virtual key, then only the first one is returned.

### sdl.keyboard.getState()

- Returns: `<boolean[]>` an array representing the state of each key.

The returned array can be indexed with [`Scancode`](#enum-scancode) values.
Each value in the array is either `true` if the corresponding key is pressed, or `false` otherwise.

## sdl.mouse

### Enum: BUTTON

Used to represent the buttons on a mouse.
A mouse can have many buttons, but the values for the three most common ones are represented in this enum.

| Value                     | Corresponding `SDL_BUTTON_*` |
| ---                       | ---                          |
| `sdl.mouse.BUTTON.LEFT`   | `SDL_BUTTON_LEFT`            |
| `sdl.mouse.BUTTON.MIDDLE` | `SDL_BUTTON_MIDDLE`          |
| `sdl.mouse.BUTTON.RIGHT`  | `SDL_BUTTON_RIGHT`           |

### sdl.mouse.getButton(button)

- `button: <number>` The index of the button.
- Returns: `<boolean>` Is `true` if the button is pressed.

Queries the state of a single mouse button.

### sdl.mouse.position

- `<object>`
  - `x: <number>` The x position of the mouse, relative to the screen.
  - `y: <number>` The y position of the mouse, relative to the screen.

The position of the mouse on the screen.

### sdl.mouse.setPosition(x, y)

- `x: <number>` The new x position of the mouse, relative to the screen.
- `y: <number>` The new y position of the mouse, relative to the screen.

Moves the mouse to the specified position.

### sdl.mouse.setCursor(cursor)

- `cursor: <MouseCursor>` The icon to use for the cursor.

Changes the icon that is displayed for the mouse cursor.

Possible values for `cursor` are:

| Value         | Corresponding `SDL_SystemCursor` | Description                                              |
| ---           | ---                              | ---                                                      |

## sdl.controller

An SDL controller is an abstraction over [`joysticks`](#sdljoystick) based on the xbox360 controller: They have a dpad, two analog sticks, 4 buttons on the right (called A, B, X, Y), shoulder buttons (two of which might be axes) and 3 buttons in the middle ("Start", "Back" and usually some kind of logo-button called "Guide").
The SDL controller abstraction uses the naming-conventions of xbox360/XInput for all supported devices (for example devices that have a similar layout, like the Playstation DualShock Controller, but different button names), so you'll know that for example `controllerInstance.axes.leftStickX` is always the x-axis of the left analog stick, or `controllerInstance.buttons.b` is always the rightmost button of the 4 buttons on the right.
This makes it easy to provide consistent input bindings, like "press B to jump, move around with the left analog stick".
With a pure joystick instance it's impossible to know which axis or button corresponds to which physical axis/button on the device.

Because controllers are an abstraction over joysticks, they operate on the same set of devices (if a joystick device and a controller device have the same id, then they refer to the same underlying physical device).
For a joystick device to also be available as a controller device it needs a "mapping".
A mapping is a string that consists of the device's GUID, its name, and a series of pairings between one joystick axis/button and the corresponding controller axis/button name.
See the sample output [`here`](#sdlcontrollerdevices) for an example.
SDL has pretty good default controller mappings, but if you need more, there's a community sourced database available on [gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB](https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB).
Add them via:

```js
const url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/master/gamecontrollerdb.txt'
const result = await fetch(url)
const text = await result.text()
const mappings = text.split('\n').filter((line) => line && !line.startsWith('#'))
sdl.controller.addMappings(mappings)

Equivalent to [`controllerInstance.rumbleTriggers(0, 0)`](#controllerinstancerumbletriggersleft-right-duration).

### controllerInstance.closed

- `<boolean>`

Is `true` if the instance is closed.
A closed instance object must not be used any further.

### controllerInstance.close()

Closes the instance.

## sdl.sensor

### sdl.sensor.STANDARD_GRAVITY

- `<number>`

Accelerometers are affected by the force of gravity:
even if the device is completely at rest, it will still indicata an acceleration with a magnitude of [`sdl.sensor.STANDARD_GRAVITY`](#sdlsensorstandard_gravity) away from the center of the earth.
Use the `sdl.sensor.STANDARD_GRAVITY` constant to correct for gravitational acceleration if your application requires it.

### sdl.sensor.devices

- `<object>[]`
  - `id: <number>` The unique id of the device.
  - `name: <string>` The name of the device.
  - `type: <string>|<null>` Either `'accelerometer'` or `'gyroscope'`. Is `null` if it can't be determined.
  - `side: <string>|<null>` Either `'left'` or `'right'`. Is `null` if the sensor does not have a side, or the value can't be determined.

A list of all the detected sensor devices.

Some sensors have a `side`, sucha as those on the Joy-Con controller.
For most other sensors `side` is `null`.

Sample output:

// TODO

### sdl.sensor.openDevice(device)

- `device: <object>` An object from [`sdl.sensor.devices`](#sdlsensordevices) that is to be opened.
- Returns: [`<SensorInstance>`](#class-sensorinstance) an object representing the opened sensor device instance.

Initializes a sensor device and returns a corresponding instance.

## class SensorInstance

The `SensorInstance` class is not directly exposed by the API so you can't (and shouldn't) use it with the `new` operator.
Instead, objects returned by [`sdl.sensor.openDevice()`](#sdlsensoropendevicedevice) are of type `SensorInstance`.

<a id="sensor-instance-event-update"></a>

### Event: 'update'

Fired when the sensor's data changes.
Get the new data by accessing [`sensorInstance.data`](#sensorinstancedata)

<a id="sensor-instance-event-close"></a>

### Event: 'close'

Fired when the instance is about to close.
Handle cleanup here.

### sensorInstance.device

- `<object>`

The [device](#sdlsensordevices) from which the `sensorInstance` was opened.

### sensorInstance.data

- `<object>`
  - `timestamp: <number>|<null>` The time the latest measurement was taken __in microseconds__, or `null` if it can't be determined.
  - `x: <number>` X axis value.
  - `y: <number>` Y axis value.
  - `z: <number>` Z axis value.

An object reporting the latest measurement from the sensor.

For accelerometers, the `x`, `y`, and `z` values correspond to the current acceleration in meters per second squared.
Keep in mind the accelerometers are affected by the force of gravity:
even if the device is completely at rest, it will still indicata an acceleration with a magnitude of [`sdl.sensor.STANDARD_GRAVITY`](#sdlsensorstandard_gravity) away from the center of the earth.

For gyroscopes, the `x`, `y`, and `z` values correspond to the current rate of rotation in radians per second.
The rotation is positive in the counter-clockwise direction, meaning that an observer looking from a positive location on one of the axes would see positive rotation on that axis when it appeared to be rotating counter-clockwise.

For phones held in portrait mode and game controllers held in front of you, the axes are defined as follows:

- -X ... +X : left ... right
- -Y ... +Y : bottom ... top
- -Z ... +Z : farther ... closer

### sensorInstance.closed

- `<boolean>`

Is `true` if the instance is closed.
A closed instance object must not be used any further.

### sensorInstance.close()

Closes the instance.

## sdl.audio

### Audio data

The [`playbackInstance.enqueue()`](#playbackinstanceenqueuebuffer-bytes) function expects a buffer of audio data as input and the [`recordingInstance.dequeue()`](#recordinginstancedequeuebuffer-bytes) function returns a buffer of audio data as output.
The format of the data in these buffers depends on the options you passed to [`sdl.audio.openDevice()`](#sdlaudioopendevicedevice-options).

An audio buffer is a sequence of frames, and each frame is a sequence of samples.
A _sample_ is a single number representing the intensity of an audio channel at a point in time.
For audio with multiple channels, each point in time is represented by multiple samples (one per channel) that together make up a _frame_.
The samples in a frame are arranged as follows:

- For 1 channel (mono) a frame contains just the one sample.
- For 2 channels (stereo) the frame contains two samples and the layout is: left, right. This means that the first sample corresponds to the left channel and the second sample corresponds to the right channel.
- For 4 channels (quad) the layout is front-left, front-right, rear-left, rear-right.
- For 6 channels (5.1) the layout is front-left, front-right, center, low-freq, rear-left, rear-right.

So for example, to play 3 seconds of a 440Hz sine wave, you could do:

```js
const TWO_PI = 2 * Math.PI

const {
  channels,
  frequency,
  bytesPerSample,
  minSampleValue,
  maxSampleValue,
  zeroSampleValue,
} = playbackInstance

const range = maxSampleValue - minSampleValue
const amplitude = range / 2

const sineAmplitude = 0.3 * amplitude
const sineNote = 440
const sinePeriod = 1 / sineNote

const duration = 3
const numFrames = duration * frequency
const numSamples = numFrames * channels
const numBytes = numSamples * bytesPerSample
const buffer = Buffer.alloc(numBytes)

let offset = 0
for (let i = 0; i < numFrames; i++) {
  const time = i / frequency
  const angle = time / sinePeriod * TWO_PI
  const sample = zeroSampleValue + Math.sin(angle) * sineAmplitude
  for (let j = 0; j < channels; j++) {
    offset = playbackInstance.writeSample(buffer, sample, offset)
  }
}

playbackInstance.enqueue(buffer)
playbackInstance.play()
```

### Sample formats

### sdl.audio.bytesPerSample(format)

- `format: `[`<SampleFormat>`](#sample-formats): The desired sample format.
- Returns: `<number>` The number of bytes.

Helper function which maps each sample format to the corresponding number of bytes its samples take up.

This function is also available from `@kmamal/sdl/helpers`.

- `buffer: <Buffer>` The buffer to read the sample from.
- `offset: <number>` The position from which to read the sample. Default: `0`
- Returns: `<number>` The value of the sample read.

Helper function which calls the appropriate `read*` method of `Buffer` based on the format argument.
For example, a call to `sdl.audio.readSample('f32', buffer, offset)` would be equivalent to `buffer.readFloatLE(offset)`.

This function is also available from `@kmamal/sdl/helpers`.

### sdl.audio.writeSample(format, buffer, value[, offset])

- `format: `[`<SampleFormat>`](#sample-formats): The desired sample format.
- `buffer: <Buffer>` The buffer to write the sample to.
- `value: <number>` The value of the sample to write.
- `offset: <number>` The position at which to write the sample. Default: `0`
- Returns: `<number>` The updated `offset`.

Helper function which calls the appropriate `write*` method of `Buffer` based on the format argument.
For example, a call to `sdl.audio.writeSample('f32', buffer, value, offset)` would be equivalent to `buffer.writeFloatLE(value, offset)`.

This function is also available from `@kmamal/sdl/helpers`.

### sdl.audio.devices

- `<object>[]`
  - `type: <string>` Either `'playback'` or `'recording'`.
  - `name: <string>` The name of the device.

A list of all the detected audio devices.
Sample output for PulseAudio:

```js
[
  { name: 'Built-in Audio Analog Stereo', type: 'playback' },
  { name: 'Built-in Audio Analog Stereo', type: 'recording' },
]
```

Note that `sdl.audio.devices` may sometimes be an empty list.
Despite that, in many common cases, it's still possible to successfully open the default device by only passing `type` to [`sdl.audio.openDevice()`](#sdlaudioopendevicedevice-options) like this:

```js
const playbackInstance = sdl.audio.openDevice({ type: 'playback' })
```

### sdl.audio.openDevice(device[, options])

- `device: <object>` An object from [`sdl.audio.devices`](#sdlaudiodevices), or a custom device.
  - `type: <string>`: Either `'playback'` or `'recording'`.
  - `name: <string>|<null>`: The name of the device. Optional.
- `options: <object>`
  - `channels: <number>`: Number of audio channels. Valid values: `1`, `2`, `4`, `6`. Default: `1`
  - `frequency: <number>`: The sampling frequency in frames per second. Default: `48e3`
  - `format: `[`<SampleFormat>`](#sample-formats): The binary format for each sample. Default: `'f32'`
  - `buffered: <number>`: Number of frames buffered by the driver. Must be a power of `2`. Default: `4096`
- Returns: [`<AudioInstance>`](#class-audioinstance) an object representing the opened audio device instance.

Initializes an audio device for playback/recording and returns a corresponding instance.
If the opened device is a playback device, then it returns an [`AudioPlaybackInstance`](#class-audioplaybackinstance-extends-audioinstance), otherwise it returns an [`AudioRecordingInstance`](#class-audiorecordinginstance-extends-audioinstance).

Most of the time, you will be passing objects from [`sdl.audio.devices`](#sdlaudiodevices) for the `device` argument:

```js
const device = sdl.audio.devices[selectedIndex]
const playbackInstance = sdl.audio.openDevice(device)
```

It's also possible to let SDL pick the most appropriate device by only passing the `type` property:

```js
const playbackInstance = sdl.audio.openDevice({ type: 'playback' })
```

Some audio drivers also support arbitrary and driver-specific strings for the device `name` such as hostname/IP address for a remote audio server, or a filename in the diskaudio driver.
These drivers usually return an empty list for [`sdl.audio.devices`](#sdlaudiodevices).

The `channels`, `frequency` and `format` options together define how the data is laid out in the `Buffer` objects that you write to playback instances of read from recording instances.
See also the section on [audio data](#audio-data).

The `buffered` option specifies the "delay" between the application and the audio driver.
With smaller values you have smaller delays, but you also have to read/write data from/to the driver more frequently.
Applications such as virtual instruments that need to play audio in reaction to user input should set `buffered` to a lower value.

## class AudioInstance

The `AudioInstance` class is not directly exposed by the API so you can't (and shouldn't) use it with the `new` operator.
It only serves as the base class for [`AudioPlaybackInstance`](#class-audioplaybackinstance-extends-audioinstance) and [`AudioRecordingInstance`](#class-audiorecordinginstance-extends-audioinstance).

- `buffer: <Buffer>` The buffer to read the sample from.
- `offset: <number>` The position from which to read the sample. Default: `0`
- Returns: `<number>` The value of the sample read.

Helper function which calls the appropriate `read*` method of `Buffer` based on the format the instance was opened with.
For example, for an instance opened with the `'f32'` sample format, a call to `audioinstance.readSample(buffer, offset)` would be equivalent to `buffer.readFloatLE(offset)`.

### audioInstance.writeSample(buffer, value[, offset])

- `buffer: <Buffer>` The buffer to write the sample to.
- `value: <number>` The value of the sample to write.
- `offset: <number>` The position at which to write the sample. Default: `0`

## Helpers

The `@kmamal/sdl` library must only be imported from the main thread.
If you try importing it from a `worker_thread` you will get an error.
This is mainly due to some limitations in SDL itself (it's often unsafe to call functions from threads other than the one that called `SDL_Init`) as well as Node.js native modules (each thread gets its own instance of the module and it's hard to make them talk with each other).

It's often useful however to offload CPU-heavy work to a thread, so the main thread can respond to input events faster.
This is still possible!
Even if the threads do not have access to the SDL-related functions, they can still write data to buffers and then pass those buffers to the main thread from where they can be passed to SDL.
One thing is missing: While the core of the library is not needed, it's nice to have the helper functions, for example when writing an audio renderer it's nice to have the [`readSample`](#sdlaudioreadsampleformat-buffer-offset), [`writeSample`](#sdlaudiowritesampleformat-buffer-value-offset), etc functions.

Since these are just helpers and don't call any SLD code underneath it's safe to use them.
They are made available through the `@kmamal/sdl/helpers` sub-module that does not load any of the native code.
For an example of their use see [this example](https://github.com/kmamal/node-sdl/blob/master/examples/12-audio-thread/audio-worker.js).

The functions included in `@kmamal/sdl/helpers` are:

- [`sdl.audio.bytesPerSample`](#sdlaudiobytespersampleformat)
- [`sdl.audio.minSampleValue`](#sdlaudiominsamplevalueformat)
- [`sdl.audio.maxSampleValue`](#sdlaudiomaxsamplevalueformat)
- [`sdl.audio.zeroSampleValue`](#sdlaudiozerosamplevalueformat)
- [`sdl.audio.readSample`](#sdlaudioreadsampleformat-buffer-offset)
- [`sdl.audio.writeSample`](#sdlaudiowritesampleformat-buffer-value-offset)

## Building from source

If prebuilt binaries are not available for your platform, `@kmamal/sdl` tries to compile itself during installation.
A few prerequisites are necessary for that to work:

First, install [node-addon-api](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api) and [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) with all its dependencies.

On Mac, you also need to install `xquartz` so that SDL can find the X11 headers it needs.
The command to install `quartz` via homebrew is `brew install xquartz`.

You don't need to install any SDL libraries or headers.
These are downloaded automatically through the [@kmamal/build-sdl](https://github.com/kmamal/build-sdl) package.
If `@kmamal/build-sdl` has no prebuilt library for your platform, it tries to compile one on the spot.
You need to have `cmake` installed for that to work.

---

You could also have found your way to the "Building from source" section because you are trying to contribute to this package.
There are some npm scripts in `package.json` that could be of use to you:

- `npm run clean` deletes all folders that are created during the build, as well as `node_modules`.
- `npm run download-release` downloads the prebuilt binaries. This is the first thing the install script tries to do.
- `npm run download-sdl` downloads the SDL headers and libraries from `@kmamal/build-sdl` so you can compile against them in later steps. This is the second step in the install script, after `download-release` has failed.
- `npm run build` prepares the environment variables and calls `node-gyp` to build the package.
- `NODE_SDL_FROM_SOURCE=1 npm install` runs the install script normally, but skips the inital attempt to download the binaries, and goes straight to building from source.

The SDL headers and libs get downloaded to `sdl/`, the build happens in `build/`, and the final binaries get collected into `dist/`.

The way I normally work is I run `npm run clean` to start fresh, then run `NODE_SDL_FROM_SOURCE=1 npm i` once to prepare everything, then as I make changes I run `npm run build` to re-build the package.

Have fun!
